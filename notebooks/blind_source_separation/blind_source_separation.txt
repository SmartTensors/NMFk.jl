NMFk Notebook: Blind Source Separation
-----

An example problem demonstrating how **NMFk** can be applied to extract unknown signals or signatures embeded (mixed) in unknown fasion in analyzed datasets.

This type of analysis is frequently called **blind source separation** or **feature extraction**.

Applying **NMFk**, we can automatically:

- identify the number of the unknown mixed signatures in a dataset 
- estimate the shape of the unknown mixed signatures
- estimate how the signatures are mixed at each sensor

**NMFk** is a code within the [SmartTensors](https://github.com/SmartTensors) framework.

If **NMFk** is not installed, first execute in the Julia REPL: `import Pkg; Pkg.add("NMFk"); Pkg.add("Mads")`.

Let us generate 3 random signals:

The singals look like this:

We can collect the 3 signal vectors into a signal matrix `W`:

Now we can mix the signals in matrix `W` to produce a data matrix `X` representing data collected at 5 sensors (e.g., measurement devices or wells at different locations).

Each of the 5 sensors is observing some mixture of the signals in `W`.

The way the 3 signals are mixed at the sensors is represented by the mixing matrix `H`.

Let us define the mixing matrix `H` as:

Each column of the `H` matrix defines how the 3 signals are represented in each sensors.

For example, the first sensor (column 1 above) detects only Signals 1 and 3; Signal 2 is missing because `H[2,1]` is equal to zero.

The second sensor (column 2 above) detects Signals 1 and 2; Signal 3 is missing because `H[3,2]` is equal to zero.

The entries of `H` matrix also define the proportions at which the signals are mixed.

For example, the first sensor (column 1 above) detects Signal 3 times stronger than Signal 1.

The data matrix `X` is formed by multiplying `W` and `H` matrices. `X` defines the actual data observed.

The data matrix `X` looks like this:

Now, we can assume that we only know the data matrix `X` and the `W` and `H` matrices are unknown.

We can execute **NMFk** and analyze the data matrix `X`.

**NMFk** will automatically:

- identify the number of the unknown mixed signals in `X` 
- estimate the shape of the unknown mixed signals (i.e., estimate the entries of `W` matrix)
- estimate how the signals are mixed at the 5 sensors (i.e., estimate the entries of `H` matrix)

This can be done based only on the information in `X`:

**NMFk** returns the estimated optimal number of signals `kopt` which in this case, as expected, is equal to 3.

**NMFk** also returns estimates of matrices `W` and `H`.

Here the estimates of matrices W and H are stored as `We` and `He` objects.

`We[kopt]` and `He[kopt]` are scaled versions of the original `W` and `H` matrices:

Note that the order of columns ('signals') in `W` and `We[kopt]` are not expected to match.

Also note that the order of rows ('sensors') in `H` and `He[kopt]` are also not expected to match.

The estimated order of 'signals' will be different every time the code is executed.

Below are plots providing comparisons between the original and estimated `W` an `H` matrices.
