NMFk example: Feature extraction
-----

An example problem demonstrating how **NMFk** can be applied to extract and clasify features and sensors observing these mixed features.

This type of analysis is related to **blind source separation**

Applying **NMFk**, we can automatically:

- identify the number of the unknown mixed signatures in dataset 
- estimate the shape of the unknown mixed signatures
- estimate how the signatures are mixed at each sensor
- clasify sensors based on how they observe (are impacted) the extracted features.

**NMFk** is a code within the **SmartTensors** framework.

If **NMFk** is not installed, first execute in the Julia REPL: `import Pkg; Pkg.add("NMFk"); Pkg.add("Mads")`.

Let us generate 4 random signals with legnth of 100 (this can be considered as 100 ):

The singals look like this:

Now we can mix the signals in matrix `W` to produce a data matrix `X` representing data collected at 10 sensors (e.g., measurement devices or wells at different locations).

Each of the 10 sensors is observing some mixture of the 4 signals in `W`.

The way the 4 signals are mixed at the sensors is represented by the mixing matrix `H`.

Let us define the mixing matrix `H` as:

Each column of the `H` matrix defines how the 3 signals are represented in each sensors.

For example, the first sensor (column 1 above) detects only Signals 1 and 3; Signal 2 is missing because `H[2,1]` is equal to zero.

The second sensor (column 2 above) detects Signals 1, 2 and 4; Signal 3 is missing because `H[3,2]` is equal to zero.

The entries of `H` matrix also define the proportions at which the signals are mixed.

For example, the first sensor (column 1 above) detects Signal 3 times stronger than Signals 1 and 4.

The data matrix `X` is formed by multiplying `W` and `H` matrices. `X` defines the actual data observed.

The data matrix `X` looks like this:

Now, we can assume that we only know the data matrix `X` and the `W` and `H` matrices are unknown.

We can execute **NMFk** and analyze the data matrix `X`.

**NMFk** will automatically:

- identify the number of the unknown mixed signals in `X` 
- estimate the shape of the unknown mixed signals (i.e., estimate the entries of `W` matrix)
- estimate how the signals are mixed at the 5 sensors (i.e., estimate the entries of `H` matrix)

This can be done based only on the information in `X`:

**NMFk** returns the estimated optimal number of signals `kopt` which in this case, as expected, is equal to 4.

A plot of the fit and the robustness is shown below:

Acceptable (underfitting) solutions:

**NMFk** also returns estimates of matrices `W` and `H`.

Here the estimates of matrices W and H are stored as `We` and `He` objects.

`We[kopt]` and `He[kopt]` are scaled versions of the original `W` and `H` matrices:

Note that the order of columns ('signals') in `W` and `We[kopt]` are not expected to match.

Also note that the order of rows ('sensors') in `H` and `He[kopt]` are also not expected to match.

The estimated order of 'signals' will be different every time the code is executed.

Below are plots providing comparisons between the original and estimated `W` an `H` matrices.

Figures above demonstrate the accurate reconstruction of the original `W` and `H` matrices.

**NMFk** results can be further analyzed as demonstrated below:

The code above perform analyses of all the acceptable solutions.
These are solutions with number of extracted features equal to 2, 3, and 4.
The solution with 4 features is the optimal one.
The solutions for 2 and 3 features are underfitting but informative as well.

Extracted features beased on the solutions for 2, 3, and 4 signals look like this:

The 10 sensors are grouped intp 4 groups.
The sensor grouping is based on which of the 4 signals are mostly detected by the 4 sensors.
The sensor grouping is listed below:

This grouping is based on analyses of the attribute matrix `H` presented below.
The grouping process tries to pick up the most important signal observed by each sensor.
However, there are challanges when more than one signal is present.

The clustering of the sensors into groups at the different levels of clsutering is visualized below:
